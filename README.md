## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

In this hands-on tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to build a simple React app (a quiz app) using AWS Amplify and Cognito.  We‚Äôll also see how to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub.

## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

* Set up environment
* Create the React App
* Add authentication with Cognito
* Add functionality and styling for quiz
* Push local code to GitHub
* Host the front end in Amplify via GitHub (for CI/CD)


## <a name="quick-start">ü§∏ Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Setting up the environment and installing the Amplify CLI

* Open visual studio code and in the terminal we're going to do an npm install for the amplify CLI:
* Copy and paste the command in the terminal `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`


![1](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/7a86af16-c2c7-40c9-9432-28281633f324)


* Next we need to configure amplify, this basically makes the CLI work with your AWS accounts, we'll have to set up a new user configure access keys. The command for that its just `amplify configure`
* And that will launch a page to the AWS console asking you to sign in as an administrator account that has admin permissions, after you're signed in you just press enter

![2](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/38ac248c-8e4c-4416-ba89-5a55080d5cd0)


* Choose your region, i'm in `us-east-1`, just use your arrow keys up and down to select your region and then hit enter

![4](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/862de61c-5eca-47fe-8d0c-bf30f04205a0)


* Then this will launch the amplify documentation with instructions on what you need to do next, it's basically giving
you a step- byep of what's happening, we've already run amplify configure and select our region

![5](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/7763462e-8fe7-4c6f-bac5-83e0a76d2d1a)


* Next what we need to do is navigate to the IAM user creation page in the console, and create a user

![6](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/c2abfb5b-952a-45d5-914d-0727e5c49fd1)


* I'm going to call the user `amplify-dev` you can choose another name if you want then click next

![7](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/680bd858-a23d-43fe-be5e-343996e2d4c9)


* Next, for permissions options select `attach policies directly` then select the policy called `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` then click Next
(if you don't see the policy name you can just type in amplify in the search bar and that will filter for you the policy name)

![8](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/43ebf783-f0c7-48d1-ae1b-8cecaf84f788)


* Next you need to enter the access key ID and the secret access key for that user that you just created, back to IAM console select the user you just created


![9](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/11e7a913-4b1d-4010-bbd9-20e67c91eed3)


* Then you want to come to the security credentials Tab and scrolling down to access keys and create one

![11](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/fdcfb227-ed2b-40c7-8b0d-54d2b5d37e67)


* Specifically these will be for the CLI so select that, scroll down understand and accept and click next and create access key. 

![12](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/87984ef4-38fc-467d-99b0-b7260d9a7d21)


* You want to copy the access key go back to visual studio and paste it.

![13](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/7a7af09b-e153-40ba-a0b4-6502b4d3f7af)
