## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Setting up the environment and installing the Amplify CLI

* Open visual studio code and in the terminal we're going to do an npm install for the amplify CLI:
* Copy and paste the command in the terminal `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`


![1](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/7a86af16-c2c7-40c9-9432-28281633f324)


* Next we need to configure amplify, this basically makes the CLI work with your AWS accounts, we'll have to set up a new user configure access keys. The command for that its just `amplify configure`
* And that will launch a page to the AWS console asking you to sign in as an administrator account that has admin permissions, after you're signed in you just press enter

![2](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/38ac248c-8e4c-4416-ba89-5a55080d5cd0)


* Choose your region, i'm in `us-east-1`, just use your arrow keys up and down to select your region and then hit enter

![4](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/862de61c-5eca-47fe-8d0c-bf30f04205a0)


* Then this will launch the amplify documentation with instructions on what you need to do next, it's basically giving
you a step- byep of what's happening, we've already run amplify configure and select our region

![5](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/7763462e-8fe7-4c6f-bac5-83e0a76d2d1a)


* Next what we need to do is navigate to the IAM user creation page in the console, and create a user

![6](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/c2abfb5b-952a-45d5-914d-0727e5c49fd1)


* I'm going to call the user `amplify-dev` you can choose another name if you want then click next

![7](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/680bd858-a23d-43fe-be5e-343996e2d4c9)


* Next, for permissions options select `attach policies directly` then select the policy called `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` then click Next
(if you don't see the policy name you can just type in amplify in the search bar and that will filter for you the policy name)

![8](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/43ebf783-f0c7-48d1-ae1b-8cecaf84f788)


* Next you need to enter the access key ID and the secret access key for that user that you just created, back to IAM console select the user you just created


![9](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/11e7a913-4b1d-4010-bbd9-20e67c91eed3)


* Then you want to come to the security credentials Tab and scrolling down to access keys and create one

![11](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/fdcfb227-ed2b-40c7-8b0d-54d2b5d37e67)


* Specifically these will be for the CLI so select that, scroll down understand and accept and click next and create access key. 

![12](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/87984ef4-38fc-467d-99b0-b7260d9a7d21)


* You want to copy the the access key ID and the secret access key go back to visual studio and paste it.

![13](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/7a7af09b-e153-40ba-a0b4-6502b4d3f7af)


* And then you would like to update or create AWS profile on your local machine, i'm going to call mine `amplify-dev-local` and this will save this information like the region, the keys on your local machine so that you don't have to do this every time so we'll hit enter and success

![14](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/6f0fe657-21d6-4c26-a266-ad436cec3332)


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Creating a new React app from VS Code

* Back to vs code i'm going to run `npx create-react-app <name of your app>` and then whatever name you want to give it, i'm calling mine `my-quiz-app` this will install a vanilla react app
* And then you want to change directories into whatever you named your app by running `cd <name of your app>`

1. Next we need to initialize the amplify project within the react app, here it's going to ask you a series of questions like what do you want to name your amplify app in the cloud, what language are you using, what's your local IDE, to do that let run `amplify init` (it is recommended to run this from the root we're already in there):

2. The name for the project this is the name that's going to show up in the AWS console when we go look at our amplify projects, it's different from what we just created locally on our file system, i will name it `myquizapp`

3. Then click `Yes` to initailize the project the default configuration (you can select no if you want to customize the configuration)

4. For authentication method, we did save the AWS profile that we set up earlier, you could enter Keys again but let's go with the AWS profile

5. I called my `amplify-dev-local` so I'll select that


![16](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/ebc2313b-9f3b-4591-a8cb-c4080b92d9e0)


6. Next question, do we want to help amplify improve by sharing non-sensitive project configurations i'm going to say No 


![17](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/06337109-a597-45e1-aa01-958fa529abed)


* If we go out to the AWS console, i'll navigate to amplify, we've got my quiz app so this is the one that I just created from the command line

![19](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/8f9fa609-2158-4e50-ba15-1a1227823784)


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 3 - Adding authentication to the React app using Cognito

1.  To Add authentication to the React app using Cognito, back to vs code in the command line run `amplify add auth`

* This will ask you some questions about what exactly you want to do:

2. We're going to go with a default configuration that will give us Cognito
3. You can do Federation with a social provider like Facebook or Google, you can do manual configuration but we're just going to go
with the default
4. We want users to sign in using an email
5. We don't want to do any advanced settings

![20](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/cefbd17c-472c-4ccc-b1b4-97003a579f69)


* Let's push everything to AWS by running the command `amplify push` then hit continue, and everything will be deployed.

![21](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/def8ff53-d521-4fe8-9d70-4267e41538a2)



* Validating the Cognito user pool was successfully created:

Cognito is built around the concept of a user pool, which is basically a pool of users that are going to register and log into your application, if you check the back to Cognito console, we should see a new user pool created for us

![22](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/46178d2b-6c55-4bc4-b007-4ae61a0a6a57)


* Adding the aws-amplify/ui-react libraries for the Cognito sign-in UI: Let's get the UI set up enough that we can actually create an account and log in as a new user.

* Back to vs code, i'm going to open up the `app.js` file, this is our main file for the react application, i'm going to replace code with my code that i put out in GitHub (grab the code above in "Code Snippets")

* Before test our react app, we do have the quiz functionality in the code in which we haven't implemented yet so let me just comment that out first: its `import Quiz from './Quiz';` and `<Quiz />`

![Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 11 36 31](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/8efc8b4c-a483-44c1-b8a5-160eaba89621)


* There's one other thing we need to do, we need to install the amplify libraries that give us the Login user interface, to do that we will run the command `npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react` then `npm start`

![23](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/63250cf0-817c-4141-a430-9754cec66951)


* Running the React app to register for an account and log in using Cognito, Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

![25](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/3d72bdaf-5162-409a-8688-e08607983f68)

* To create an account or sign in, you do need to use a valid email, it's going to send you a code that you have to use to activate the email


![25](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/4db2061e-8f67-4bcc-8883-1af075345c66)

* I'll enter my email password and create the account, it has emailed me a code i'll go grab that confirmation code, enter that  and confirm, this is a legit user account and that logged me in

![26](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/a39f068c-b353-4e07-869e-54fd1293cb0a)


* Now if we go back to Cognito console and look at our user pool and refresh the users you'll see that we have one user


![27](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws-amplify-cognito-app/assets/110755734/7621ea2d-5517-411d-9586-025cbdab4f8e)
